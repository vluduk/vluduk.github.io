        <div class="common box5">
            Stanley claimed that, starting in 1879, after eleven years working as a cowboy, he studied for more than two years with a Hopi medicine man at Walpi, Arizona. This supposedly included learning the "secrets of snake oil". 
            With the help of a Boston druggist he began marketing his product at Western medicine shows. 
            In 1893 he and his rattlesnakes gained attention at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.
            Later he went on to establish production facilities in Beverly, Massachusetts and Providence, Rhode Island.
            In 1916, subsequent to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, Stanley's concoction was examined and found to be of no value. It was found to contain mineral oil, a fatty compound thought to be from beef, capsaicin from chili peppers, and turpentine. He was fined $20.00 (approximately $570 in 2024).
            The term "snake oil" would go on to become a popular euphemism for ineffective or fraudulent products, particularly those marketed as medicines or cures.
