          Snake oil is a term used to describe deceptive marketing, health care
          fraud, or a scam.

      <div class="common box5">
        In multi-level marketing, the compensation plan usually pays out to
        participants from two potential revenue streams. The first is based on a
        sales commission from directly selling the product or service; the
        second is paid out from commissions based upon the wholesale purchases
        made by other sellers whom the participant has recruited to also sell
        product. In the organizational hierarchy of MLM companies, recruited
        participants (as well as those whom the recruit recruits) are referred
        to as one's downline distributors. MLM salespeople are, therefore,
        expected to sell products directly to end-user retail consumers by means
        of relationship referrals and word of mouth marketing, but more
        importantly they are incentivized to recruit others to join the
        company's distribution chain as fellow salespeople so that these can
        become downline distributors. According to a report that studied the
        business models of 350 MLM companies in the United States, published on
        the Federal Trade Commission's website, at least 99% of people who join
        MLM companies lose money. Nonetheless, MLM companies function because
        downline participants are encouraged to hold onto the belief that they
        can achieve large returns, while the statistical improbability of this
        is de-emphasized. MLM companies have been made illegal or otherwise
        strictly regulated in some jurisdictions as merely variations of the
        traditional pyramid scheme
